Game Engine Requirements:
	1. A window class
	2. window class should have members, 
		A)Draw image onto screen to respective coordinates
		B)Draw image ignoring specific colors
		C)Reload the image
		D)Close the window
		E)Size of the window in the constructor
Thats for starters and I will think of the others on the go.

May change the close function in the engine.
Have to add a function in the engine for rotating images.
And have to start some part of the game.
