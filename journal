Game Engine Requirements:
	1. A window class
	2. window class should have members, 
		A)Draw image onto screen to respective coordinates
		B)Draw image ignoring specific colors
		C)Reload the image
		D)Close the window
		E)Size of the window in the constructor
Thats for starters and I will think of the others on the go.

May change the close function in the engine.
Have to add a function in the engine for rotating images.
And have to start some part of the game.

I want to stop the engine currently and start the game using openGL for drawing, SDL for input from keyboard or mouse and glut for window management.

Just thought about some cool ideas for the game. If its an rpg then, include classes psychic, wizard. Psychic can take knowledge/more gross brains from the people he killed and this helps him in controlling other people. Wizard on the other hand deals with spells. Other two classes I thought would be an archer and a gunsman. The archer would have different arrows. But have to think more about gunsman.
